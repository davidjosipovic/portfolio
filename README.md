# Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a developer. It includes interactive project cards with links to GitHub repositories and live demos.

## Features

- **Interactive Project Cards**: Flip cards to reveal project details.
- **Links to GitHub and Live Demos**: Easily access the source code and live versions of projects.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes.
- **Built with Next.js**: Leverages the latest features of Next.js for performance and scalability.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
